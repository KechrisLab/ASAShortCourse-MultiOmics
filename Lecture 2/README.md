Welcome to Lecture 2: Unsupervised clustering of multi-omits data!

This folder contains the data we'll be using for the lab: brca_dat.Rdata. Please have this downloaded to your computer and ready to load into R, or have the R package *Rfssa* to download directly from Github.

The folder also contains the code for the lab in a few different formats. I will be working through the Jupyter notebook, but I've also provided the code as an R script or .md files, and pdf and html files for reference.

Thank you for your attendance!
